The **Internet** tab lets you define the pattern URLs that you use to perform
targeted searches in the Internet, for example in a dictionary.

You can have as many entries as you wish, but only the first 10 will have a
hotkey assigned, either Alt+*n* within ApSIC Xbench or with Ctrl+Alt+*n* (with
the numeric keypad in this latter case in Num Lock mode) from any Windows
application. *n* can be a number from 0 to 9, where 0 means the 10th
entry in the list.

You can use the **Up** and **Down** buttons to move an entry up or down in the
list, or the **Delete** button the remove it.

The up to 10 entries with a key assigned appear in the **Internet** menu.

You can use **Internet->Capture URL** to capture URLs into this list.

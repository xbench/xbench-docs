You can define here the following settings:

* **Check weekly for new versions**. If this check box is enabled, ApSIC Xbench
  will check once a week if there are updates available.
* **Enable alternative project**. If this check box is checked, ApSIC Xbench
  keeps in memory the project opened prior to the current one. To switch back
  and forth among both projects, choose 
  **Project->Switch to Alternative Project**. To discard the alternative
  project and recall the memory	used by it, choose
  **Project->Forget Alternative Project**.
* **Load last project when ApSIC Xbench starts**. If this check box is checked,
  the next time ApSIC Xbench is started, it will load the project that was
  opened at the time of the last shut down.
* **Show warning when copying fuzzy match**. When enabled, ApSIC Xbench shows a
  warning when you press **Enter** to copy the target text of the current item
  in the search results to the clipboard.
* **Show warning when shutting down**. When enabled, ApSIC Xbench shows a
  warning when you shut it down.
* **Show QA options changed from default**. When enabled, ApSIC Xbench will
  show at the top of the QA report the QA settings that are not with its
  default value.
* **Match whole words in QA check for key terms**. When enabled, ApSIC Xbench
  will force the condition that the key term target text must match a whole
  word in the segment target text. For declined languages you will reduce false
  alarms if you leave this check box unchecked.
* **Show metadata in exported QA reports**. When enabled, ApSIC Xbench will show
  the segment metadata in the Comments column of the exported QA report.
* **Open QA Report file after exporting**. When enabled, the exported QA report file will be automatically open.
* **Default project directory**. This field allows you to specify the default
  folder for your ApSIC Xbench projects.

* **Manage Cloud Settings**. This button opens the dialog to configure Cloud Settings:
  * **Store Settings in the Cloud**: When enabled, a copy of your Xbench configuration will be stored in the cloud. That makes it available from other computers using the same Xbench account, and makes life easier in case of a reinstallation.
  * **Include Transifex Credentials and Settings**: When enabled, your Transifex username and password will also be stored in the cloud. Uncheck if you donâ€™t want your credentials to be automatically retrieved on all Xbench instances using this account.

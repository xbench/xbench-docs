From this window, you will be able to perform searches in the source text, in
the target text, or both. You can also use the **Search Options** pane
(**View->Show Search Options**) to further refine the search or to filter the
segments considered by the search. The search results are shown
according to their priority level, as defined in the **Project Properties**.

To find all instances of a certain string in the source or target part of the
text, type the string in the **Source Term** or the **Target Term** field and
press **Enter** or click **Search**. You can search from any Windows
application by copying the text to find into the clipboard (for example with
**Ctrl+Insert**) and then pressing **Ctlr+Alt+Insert** to invoke ApSIC Xbench.
If **Ctrl+Alt+Insert** clashes with another function in your Windows
application, it can be changed to another hotkey choosing
**Tools->Settings->Layout & Hotkeys**.

{{% notice note %}}
If you need to find all segments that contain some specific text in the source
part **and** some specific text in the target part, you can fill both fields
and press **Enter**.
{{% /notice %}}

By default, searches are in overview mode. This means that only some of the
most relevant matches within each priority level are shown. The overview mode
allows you to have a quick glance of results from different terminology
sources on a single screen. If you need more detail, you can choose
**View->Zoom** to show all results within a priority level, glossary, or file.
You can also double-click or press **Ctrl+Enter** on any entry in the desired
priority level of the search results to zoom by priority level.

When you activate the **Search Options** pane with **View->Show Search Options**,
the following search settings are available:

* **Show All Matches**: When checked, instead of showing an overview of search
  results, it shows all search results.
* **Only New Segments**: When checked, it shows only matches in segments that
  are not 100% matches.
* **Only 100% Matches**: When checked, it shows only matches in segments thatç
  are 100% matches.
* **Only Ongoing Translation**: When checked, it shows only matches in files
  that have been defined as ongoing translation in the project properties.
* **Exclude ICE Segments**: When checked, it excludes In-Context Exact Matches
  (also known as 101% matches or Perfect Matches) from the search results.
* **Exclude Locked Segments**: When checked, it excludes locked segments
  from the search results.  
* **Ignore Tags**: When checked, it excludes matches that are found within
  tags.

You can also further qualify the search expression for **Source**, **Target**,
or **Both** with the following settings:

* **Case Sensitive**: If checked, only matches containing the search text with
  the exact	sequence of uppercase and lowercase letters will be shown.
* **Match Whole Words**: If checked, only matches containing the search text
  in a whole word will be shown.
* **No Whitespace Trimming**: If checked, any spacing surrounding the search
  text will be also	considered as part of the search text.
* **Normalize Whitespace**: If checked, other forms of space such as a hard
  space will be	considered as a match for the space character.
* **Normalize Native Chars**: If checked, it will convert non-English
  characters to their closest variant in the English alphabet. For example, it
  will convert "á" to "a", "ñ" to "n", or "ç" to "c" prior to running the
  search. This settings allows you to search for "á" and get matches that
  contain "a", "á", "à" and other similar variants based on "a", or to search
  for "a" and also get matches that contain "a", "á", "à" and other similar
  variants based on "a". It can be useful to locate more matches when the
  source text can contain accented vowels and the writers of the source text
  were not really very careful with their typing.

There are available three search modes. The search mode is selected on the
**Search Options** pane (**View->Show Search Options**):

* **Simple**: The search expression is considered plain text.
* **Regular Expresions**: The search expression follows the 
  *regular expressions* grammar. For more information on regular expressions,
  see [Regular Expressions and Microsoft Word Wildcards]({{< relref "user-guide/regular-expressions.md" >}}).
* **MS Word Wildcards**: The search expression follows the
  *Microsoft Word wildcards* grammar. For more information on Microsoft Word
  wildcards, see [Regular Expressions and Microsoft Word Wildcards]({{< relref "user-guide/regular-expressions.md" >}}).

In addition to the search modes, you can also perform *power searches* by
pressing **Ctrl+P**. For more information on power searches, see 
[Advanced Features]({{< relref "user-guide/advanced-features.md" >}}).

If **Remove duplicates** was selected in the project properties, the **#**
column in the search results contains the number of entries that are identical
in a given file.

In addition, ApSIC Xbench uses the following conventions to qualify visually
the different types of matches.

* A green large dot (<img class="inline" style="vertical-align: middle" src ="/user-guide/bullet-green.gif" />)
  indicates that the entry matches exactly the text searched (case
  sensitive match). This can be quite convenient because you may want to
  select the entry and press **Enter** to copy its target value into the
  clipboard. By doing so, ApSIC Xbench returns to
  the original application and you can easily paste there your translation
  pressing **Shift+Insert**.
* A yellow large dot (<img class="inline" style="vertical-align: middle" src ="/user-guide/bullet-yellow.gif" />)
  indicates that the entry matches in content but has a different case 
  (case insensitive match). Normally it is also safe to paste the target text
  into the clipboard by pressing **Enter** and then **Shift+Insert**, but
  perhaps it is required to edit the case after pasting.
* A small red dot (<img class="inline" style="vertical-align: middle" src ="/user-guide/bullet-ongoing-translation.gif" />)
  indicates that the segment is part of the new translation of an
  ongoing translation. In the project properties you can mark a file as
  Ongoing Translation in order to distinguish between the new part and the
  100% matches already translated. For some formats, such as IBM Translation
  Manager or SDLX, the untranslated segments appear in the search results,
  which is indicated with the text **\*\* Untranslated \*\***. This is useful
  to help decide the best translation for a new term by quickly seeing all instances where that term will appear. If the small red dot is solid 
  (<img class="inline" style="vertical-align: middle" src ="/user-guide/bullet-ongoing-translation.gif" />),
  it means that the segment belongs to the new and changed segments of the ongoing translation. If the small red dot is empty
  (<img class="inline" style="vertical-align: middle" src ="/user-guide/bullet-hollow.gif" />),
  it means that the segment belongs to the 100% matches.
* A star indicates that the term is defined as *key term.* A green star 
  (<img class="inline" style="vertical-align: middle" src ="/user-guide/bullet-green-star.gif" />)
  indicates that the key term is an exact match (case sensitive). A yellow
  star (<img class="inline" style="vertical-align: middle" src ="/user-guide/bullet-yellow-star.gif" />) indicates that the key term is an exact match
  with regards to content, but the case of each letter does not match the
  search term. An empty	star
  (<img class="inline" style="vertical-align: middle" src ="/user-guide/bullet-hollow-star.gif" />)
  indicates that the search term is found somewhere in the key term.

From this window you can click **Add last search to checklist** also add the
term just searched to a checklist. You can also click **Search Templates** to
open a dialog from where you will be able to run predefined searches from a
set of sample templates or from entries in your checklists.

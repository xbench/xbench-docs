The **Files** tab allows you to define the search hierarchy of the ApSIC Xbench project. 
The settings defined through this dialog can be saved into the project file (.xbp extension) 
by using **Project->Save As**.

You can add files into the project by clicking **Add**, or simply by dragging and dropping a file 
or directory on the **Glossary List** and then selecting its type and properties in the window that appears.

You can increase or decrease the priority of a glossary by clicking on the plus (+) or minus (-) 
buttons that appear on the lower part of the window. You can also change the order of files within 
a priority level by clicking on the arrow buttons below the priority buttons.

You can also change any settings of a glossary by choosing the glossary and clicking the **Properties** button.

The entries of this list that appear in **bold face** are glossaries defined as **ongoing translation**. 
Glossaries defined as ongoing translation are shown with a red dot in the search results. Also, 
the QA function only consider files marked as ongoing translation.

This dialog allows you set a few common glossary properties for one or more items without having to 
click the **Properties** button for each item. To do so, simply chose one or more glossaries and then 
select the **Key Terms**, **Ongoing Translation**, **Remove Duplicates**, and **Auto-Refresh** check boxes.

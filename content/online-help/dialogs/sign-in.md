This dialog allows you to enter ApSIC Xbench using your credentials.

To create a new account, click the blue **Sign Up** link.  If you already
created an account in the past (for example for an ApSIC Xbench trial), enter
 your email in the Email field and then click the blue **Forgot Password?**
 link.

Once you have an account, enter your email and password and click **Sign In**.

If you leave the **Remember me** checked, ApSIC Xbench will not ask you for
your credentials every time you enter ApSIC Xbench.

You can also reach this dialog by choosing **Project**->**Change User** in ApSIC Xbench.

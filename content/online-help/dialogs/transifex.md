To choose a Transifex project, type a Transifex project slug or paste the URL of a Transifex project
in the field **Project Slug or URL** and then click **Connect**.

The project slug is a code that identifies your project in Transifex. The project slug is listed in the
URL, so the most convenient way to get it is to simply open your project in Transifex online and then 
copy and paste the URL here. For example if you open the Tor Project project in Transifex 
(https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/torproject/) and copy and paste the URL in the field, Xbench will 
parse to get the project slug, "torproject".

Once you have connected to a Transifex project, you can choose a language from the **Language** list
and then click **OK** to load the project strings.

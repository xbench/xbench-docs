This dialog allows you to override the values of an inherited item in a checklist. When you override the 
values or an item, the original values for the item remain unmodified in the inherited checklist. The icon
for the item becomes <img class="inline" style="vertical-align: middle" src ="/user-guide/icon-override.gif" /> so that you can identify that values were overridden.

The fields in this dialog are the following:

*	**Name**. A short name for the checklist item.
*	**Description**. A description for the checklist item.
*	**Category**. A free text category for the checklist item. You can retrieve categories previously 
	entered inthis field by clicking on the drop-down arrow at the end of this field.
*	**Powersearch**. Check this check box to indicate that the search will be in Powersearch mode. For 
	more information on the Powersearch mode, see [Advanced Features]({{< relref "user-guide/advanced-features.md" >}}).
*	**Source**. The search criteria that applies to the source text, including:
	*	The search expression
	*	The search mode (Simple, Regular Expression, MS Word Wildcard)
	*	If the search is case sensitive or not
	*	If the search should match whole words
	*	If the leading and trailing whitespace of the search string must be trimmed or preserved
	*	If the whitespace should be normalized
	*	If the native chars should be normalized
*	**Target**. The search criteria that applies to the target text, including:
	*	The search expression

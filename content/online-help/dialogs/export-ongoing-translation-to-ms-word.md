This dialog allows you to export the project files defined as ongoing translation to a Microsoft Word document. 
As exported, only the target text is proofing ready, so you can use the exported document for grammar checking 
for spell-checking in a language not supported by Xbench, such as Thai, Chinese, or Japanese.

The **Filtering** section has the following fields:

*	**Translated items**. Only the items flagged as already translated will be exported. This option can be further
	filtered to export only the **Pretranslated Items** or only the **Newly Translated Items**.
*	**Untranslated items**. This allows exporting only the untranslated items. This is useful for example to feed a
	translation machine engine.

You can also remove the repetitions from the exported file to reduce its size by checking the
**Remove repetitions in exported file** check box, exclude ICE (In-Context Exact matches) segments by checking the **Exclude ICE segments** check box, or exclude locked segments by checking the **Exclude loocked segments** check box.
